      <h1>Woman Looking Out The Window</h1>
      <p>
        The raging storm of the night before
        <br />
        left a gift for the woman of the house.
        <br />
        Curtains fly free as they frame an open scenery
        <br />
        from which the tears of the sky entered the house,
        <br />
        scattered landings on the wooden floor inside.
      </p>
      <p>
        The woman wakes up to this indoor scene
        <br />
        speechless in face of Mother Nature’s gift.
        <br />
        With heavy steps, she grabs a towel
        <br />
        to wipe Nature’s tears off the floor;
        <br />
        no complaints, just a tired mother cleaning up a mess.
      </p>
      <p>
        The wind gently hits the window glass,
        <br />
        sending soothing whistling sounds to her ears,
        <br />
        bringing hints of the salty sea to her nose,
        <br />
        gently patting her face with a calming breeze.
        <br />
        The woman is lured to look out the window,
        <br />
        welcoming her is the view of Nature’s beauty after the storm.
      </p>
      <p>
        Mother Nature’s apology to the woman
        <br />
        “Thank you for your understanding”
      </p>
