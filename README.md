# The Pittsburgh Hotel Experience

This is an interactive hypertext narrative written in HTML, using HTML tags.

## The Story

The story told in this interactive hypertext narrative is of the time when I traveled to Pittsburgh for a conference and was left alone in a hotel room at night. Through the sequence of HTML pages, I walk the reader through the story timeline, set the scene, share my thoughts, and attempt to illustrate my mood at the time. The linking of specific words and phrases to HTML pages are meant to not only allow for an interactive experience for the readers but also allow for a meaningful connection of the different pages that make up the story.

I hope that my story will inspire some reflection and thought.

## Inspiration

Inspiration for using specific words/phrases to link HTML pages to tell a story comes from Morehshin Allahyari's [The Laughing Snake](https://whitney.org/exhibitions/laughing-snake).
